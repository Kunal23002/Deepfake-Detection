# DeepFake Detection Web Application

A state-of-the-art web application that uses an ensemble of deep learning models to detect deepfake videos. The application analyzes videos and provides predictions with confidence scores about whether the content is real or fake.

## Features
- Novel ensemble approach combining EfficientNet architectures with physiological analysis
- Advanced deep learning models fine-tuned specifically for deepfake detection
- Integration of PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) for physiological signal analysis
- State-of-the-art face detection and analysis capabilities
- Real-time processing with optimized model weights
- Real-time video analysis
- Ensemble model approach combining multiple deep learning architectures
- Confidence score generation
- User-friendly web interface
- Face detection and analysis
- Support for multiple video formats (mp4, mov, avi)

## Technical Architecture

The application uses an ensemble of four powerful models:

1. **EfficientNetB0**: A lightweight but efficient convolutional neural network
2. **XceptionNet**: A deep convolutional neural network architecture
3. **EfficientNetB7**: A more complex version of EfficientNet for higher accuracy
4. **PPG (PhotoPlethysmoGraphy)**: A novel model that analyzes blood flow patterns in videos

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepfake-detection-webapp.git
cd deepfake-detection-webapp
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the model weights and place them in the appropriate directory:

```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local URL (typically http://localhost:8501)

3. Upload a video file through the web interface

4. Wait for the analysis to complete

5. View the results, including:
   - Prediction (Real/DeepFake)
   - Confidence score
   - Visual representation of predictions
